https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/71615/how-to-use-bluetooth-spi-and-uart-at-the-same-time-with-an-rpi3

After two days of reading and testing I found how to do it.

Three lines are needed to the /boot/config.txt to make it works.

#Switch Bluetooth from UART0 to UART1.
dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt
#UART1 clock is derived from system clock, so we need to fix core clock to avoid changing baudrate on bluetooth.
core_freq=250
#Set UART0 clock to normal as Rpi3 normally boot at 400Mhz (now 250Mhz) UART0 clock would biased else.
init_uart_clock=3000000
So let sum up:
- On-board Bluetooth works flawlessly with my PS3 BT Keyboard;
- Screen and touchscreen still works, hopefully;
- PN532 works like a charm using UART0 (Pin 8 & 10)
